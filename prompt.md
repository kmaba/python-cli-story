```txt
The client wants a Text Based game which contains experiences from the real world, it should contain multiple choices and pathways and let the user choose their own story?

It should have a high quality interface (for a CLI) and be intuitive to understand and not have errors or use many Libraries outside of the ones provided by Thonny.

It should ask the user for their name as it is going to be one based in a school and it should display possible options of the user at every step

It should be summarised allowing many users to play in a short timespan and also have a compelling story seperating it from others.



Engagement: Humor is also an aspect that has to be considered in engagement of the user and  'Minigames' which correlate to the story, since its a CLI it should be simple games such as ones that involve the keyboard, say for an 'English Test' the test should be a typing one or one of correcting sentences, for Math and Science it should be self explanatory. 

We can include other popular games such as one for Wordle where we can use a wordlist inbuilt pulled from (scrabble 5l)

It can also include some GUI aspects such as a small display like array which updates allowing the user which can be represented as an * to move arround an ascii hallway.

Time should also be considered.

Delegate these tasks to different agents and create a README.md which holds the plan and a TODO to be filled by the agents.
